# PictioWebRTC (WIP)

An early prototype of a game made during Protothon 2 using WebRTC.

The game rules are simple - you play against your friend (or some random stranger you just met on the interwebs), you both get 3 seconds to strike a pose, then another 3 seconds to copy your contestants pose. The one who copied the other persons pose most accurately wins the game round.

## TODO's
* Make sure to mask out the background in each picture to just get shape of the pose.
* Sort out the PeerConnection issue with the server. (maybe just use the python-server available instead of the java-version?)
* Tie everything together.

## Thanks to
The guys behind [js-imagediff](https://github.com/HumbleSoftware/js-imagediff), which we use to diff the images.
Everyone involved, the Protothon-team, the nice people at Google and Ericsson for arranging this event.
